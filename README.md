**1. Introduction:**

This documentation presents a detailed overview of a simple calculator program developed using Java. The application is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It utilizes object-oriented programming principles, specifically classes, to organize and implement its functionalities.

**2. Overview:**

The Simple Calculator program allows users to perform arithmetic calculations through a command-line interface. It prompts users to input two operands and selects the desired operation. The program then computes the result and displays it to the user.

**3. Functionalities:**

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

**4. Implementation:**

**Class Structure:**

The program consists of two main classes:

1. Calculator: This class contains methods for performing arithmetic operations.
2. Main: This class contains the main method where the program execution begins.

**Methods Description:**

1. `add(int num1, int num2)`: This method takes two integers as input and returns their sum.
2. `subtract(int num1, int num2)`: This method takes two integers as input and returns the difference between them.
3. `multiply(int num1, int num2)`: This method takes two integers as input and returns their product.
4. `divide(int num1, int num2)`: This method takes two integers as input and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second number.

**5. Testing:**

Testing of the Simple Calculator program involves validating each arithmetic operation to ensure that it produces the correct result for different input values. Various test cases covering different scenarios such as positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero values are executed to verify the accuracy of the calculations.

**6. Conclusion:**

In conclusion, the Simple Calculator program provides a basic yet functional implementation of arithmetic operations using Java. It demonstrates the use of classes and methods to organize code and perform computations efficiently. Further enhancements could include adding support for additional operations such as exponentiation and implementing a graphical user interface for improved user interaction.
